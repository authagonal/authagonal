# Directory.Build.props, NuGet.Config and the lock files are part of the restore input, not
# incidental repo furniture. Without them this stage restored a DIFFERENT graph from every other
# build of the same commit: no lock file, so nothing for --locked-mode to check; no package-source
# mapping; and an empty $(IdentityModelVersion) — so the Microsoft.IdentityModel family the token
# pipeline runs on lost its single-version pin and fell back to whatever a transitive reference
# happened to ask for. The image people actually pull was the one build in the repository not covered
# by any of it. Copied with the csprojs so the restore layer still caches on them alone.

# --locked-mode: this image is the identity provider people run. A plain restore re-resolves every
# floating dependency (10.*, 12.*) at build time and rewrites the lock file to match, so the image
# published under a release tag could contain a package graph that exists in no commit. Locked mode
# makes a drifted graph a build failure instead of a silent substitution. Passed explicitly because a
# docker build does not inherit the runner's CI=true, so the Directory.Build.props condition that
# covers restores on the runner does not reach inside this stage.
