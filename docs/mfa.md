# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Authagonal supports multi-factor authentication. Three methods are available: TOTP (authenticator apps), WebAuthn/passkeys (hardware keys and biometrics), and one-time recovery codes. Passkeys can also be used for [passwordless login](#passwordless-passkey-login).

Federated logins (SAML/OIDC) are covered too: a SAML or OIDC assertion proves the first factor, not the second. A federated user with MFA enrolled is routed through the same local MFA challenge as a password login, and a `Required` policy forces enrollment before any session is issued. Only when MFA is neither enrolled nor required does federation stand alone. A connection can opt out of the local challenge with `ChallengeMfaAfterLogin: false` (see below).

## Supported Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| **TOTP** | Time-based one-time passwords (RFC 6238): 6 digits, 30-second step, SHA-1, verified with a one-step clock-skew window. Works with any authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, etc.). A code that has already been accepted cannot be replayed within its validity window. |
| **WebAuthn / Passkeys** | FIDO2 hardware security keys, platform biometrics (Touch ID, Windows Hello), and synced passkeys. Users can register multiple passkeys, and passkeys can sign in passwordless. |
| **Recovery codes** | 10 one-time backup codes (10 characters from a 32-character alphabet, shown as `XXXXX-XXXXX`) for account recovery when other methods aren't available. Stored hashed and encrypted at rest. |

## MFA Policy

MFA enforcement is configured **per-client** via the `MfaPolicy` property in `appsettings.json`:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Disabled` (default) | Don't force enrollment; the self-service setup UI hides MFA when every client is `Disabled` |
| `Enabled` | Offer MFA enrollment; don't force it |
| `Required` | Force enrollment for users without MFA |

A user who has MFA enrolled is **always challenged at login, regardless of the client policy**. MFA is a property of the user and their session, not of the requesting client, so a request routed through a `Disabled` client cannot be used to skip an enrolled user's second factor.

```json
{
  "Clients": [
    {
      "ClientId": "my-app",
      "MfaPolicy": "Enabled"
    },
    {
      "ClientId": "admin-portal",
      "MfaPolicy": "Required"
    }
  ]
}
```

The default is `Disabled`, so existing clients are unaffected until you opt in.

### Per-User Override

Implement `IAuthHook.ResolveMfaPolicyAsync` to override the client policy for specific users:

```csharp
public Task<MfaPolicy> ResolveMfaPolicyAsync(
    string userId, string email, MfaPolicy clientPolicy,
    string clientId, CancellationToken ct)
{
    // Force MFA for admin users regardless of client setting
    if (email.EndsWith("@admin.example.com"))
        return Task.FromResult(MfaPolicy.Required);

    // Exempt service accounts
    if (email.EndsWith("@service.internal"))
        return Task.FromResult(MfaPolicy.Disabled);

    return Task.FromResult(clientPolicy);
}
```

The resolved policy governs enrollment (whether it is offered or forced). It does not exempt an already-enrolled user from the challenge; enrolled users are always challenged.

See [Extensibility](extensibility) for full hook documentation.

## Login Flow

The login flow with MFA works as follows:

1. User submits email and password to `POST /api/auth/login`
2. Server verifies password, then resolves the effective MFA policy
3. Based on the policy and the user's enrollment status:

| Policy | User has MFA? | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Any | Yes | Returns `mfaRequired`: user must verify |
| `Disabled` / `Enabled` | No | Cookie set, login complete |
| `Required` | No | Returns `mfaSetupRequired`: user must enroll |

### MFA Challenge

When `mfaRequired` is returned, the login response includes a `challengeId`, the user's available `methods`, and (when the user has passkeys) `webAuthn` assertion options. The client redirects to an MFA challenge page where the user verifies with one of their enrolled methods via `POST /api/auth/mfa/verify`:

```json
{
  "challengeId": "...",
  "method": "totp",
  "code": "123456"
}
```

`method` is `totp`, `recovery`, or `webauthn` (WebAuthn sends an `assertion` instead of a `code`).

Challenges expire after 5 minutes (configurable via `Auth:MfaChallengeExpiryMinutes`) and are consumed on successful verification.

#### Retry Budget

A wrong code does not burn the challenge. The verify endpoint validates the code first and consumes the challenge only on success, so a mistyped TOTP digit can simply be retried against the same `challengeId`. Failed attempts return `invalid_code` (or `assertion_failed` for WebAuthn) with a 401 and increment a bounded counter on the challenge; the fifth wrong attempt consumes the challenge and returns `too_many_attempts`, forcing a fresh login. This applies to all three methods.

The per-challenge budget is a fast path, not the security bound, so two further gates apply to `POST /api/auth/mfa/verify`:

- **Per-user rate limit.** More than 10 verify attempts per minute for one user returns `too_many_attempts` with a 429, whatever `challengeId` is used.
- **Shared account lockout.** Every failed code also counts against the same failed-attempt counter as the password step (`Auth:MaxFailedAttempts`, `Auth:LockoutDurationMinutes`). When it trips, the challenge is consumed and the response is `locked_out` (423). While the account is locked, verify is refused with `locked_out` before the code is checked.

Only confirmed credentials can satisfy a verification; an enrolment that was started but never completed does not count as a factor.

A missing, expired, or already-consumed challenge returns `invalid_challenge`.

### Federated Logins

After a successful SAML or OIDC assertion, the server resolves the same effective MFA policy. An MFA-enrolled user is redirected to the hosted MFA challenge page (with a `challengeId`) instead of receiving a session; a user without MFA under a `Required` policy is redirected to the MFA setup page (with a `setupToken`). The session is only marked MFA-authenticated once verification completes.

This challenge is per connection: a SAML or OIDC connection with `ChallengeMfaAfterLogin` set to `false` skips the local challenge for users who arrive through it. The default is `true`.

### Forced Enrollment

When `mfaSetupRequired` is returned, the response includes a `setupToken`. This token authenticates the user to the MFA setup endpoints (via the `X-MFA-Setup-Token` header) so they can enroll a method before getting a cookie session. Setup tokens expire after 15 minutes (configurable via `Auth:MfaSetupTokenExpiryMinutes`).

## Enrolling MFA

Users enroll MFA through the self-service setup endpoints. These require either an authenticated cookie session or a setup token.

### TOTP Setup

1. Call `POST /api/auth/mfa/totp/setup`, returns a QR code (`data:image/png;base64,...`), a `manualKey` (Base32 for manual entry), and setup token
2. User scans the QR code with their authenticator app
3. User enters the 6-digit code to confirm: `POST /api/auth/mfa/totp/confirm`

The confirm step is throttled like verify: more than 10 attempts per minute for one user returns `too_many_attempts` (429), and with a setup token the fifth wrong code consumes the setup challenge. An unconfirmed enrolment expires after 30 minutes (`setup_expired`).

### WebAuthn / Passkey Setup

1. Call `POST /api/auth/mfa/webauthn/setup`, returns a `setupToken` and `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions`
2. Client calls `navigator.credentials.create()` with the options
3. Send the attestation response to `POST /api/auth/mfa/webauthn/confirm`

Passkey enrollment requires a confirmed TOTP credential first (`totp_required_first`). Passkeys are a per-device convenience layered on top of a portable base factor, so every account keeps a device-independent factor and a `Required` policy can't be satisfied by a passkey alone.

Users can register multiple passkeys (one per device). A credential ID already registered (to any account, including the enrolling user's own) is rejected with `credential_already_registered` (409). Re-enrolling an authenticator that is already enrolled would create a second credential row sharing one credential ID: its signature counter would restart, weakening clone detection, and deleting either row would remove the lookup entry both depend on. The lookup entry is claimed with an insert-if-absent write, so two registrations of the same credential ID cannot both succeed. Users whose email domain is routed to an external IdP via forced SSO cannot enroll a local passkey (`sso_managed`), since it would bypass the IdP and its deprovisioning.

### Relying-party host

The FIDO2 relying-party ID and origin are resolved per request from the host, so each tenant hostname is its own relying party. Set `Auth:WebAuthnAllowedHosts` to the hostnames you serve, so a host outside that list cannot act as a relying party. An empty list (the default) keeps the previous behaviour rather than locking out existing passkey users on upgrade, and is logged as a gap at first use. It is not a safe resting place. Setting `AllowedHosts` in `appsettings.json` as well, so ASP.NET Core's host filtering rejects unrecognised `Host` headers before any handler runs, is the cheaper outer layer.

Independently of that list, every credential records the relying party it was enrolled under and is refused anywhere else. That is the part the request cannot influence: both ceremonies otherwise build their expectations from the same `Host` header they are verifying, so origin and `rpIdHash` were compared against a value the caller supplied, and an on-path host that forwards its own `Host` would have the origin binding, the property that makes a passkey phishing-resistant, verify it rather than prevent it. Credentials enrolled before the RP ID was recorded carry none and keep working; they gain the binding when re-enrolled.

### Recovery Codes

Call `POST /api/auth/mfa/recovery/generate` to generate 10 one-time codes. At least one confirmed primary method (TOTP or WebAuthn) must be enrolled first (`primary_method_required`), and the call needs a real authenticated session: a setup token gets `session_required` (403).

Each code is 10 characters from a 32-character alphabet, displayed as two groups of five (`XXXXX-XXXXX`).

Regenerating codes replaces all existing recovery codes. Each code can only be used once; a redeemed code is marked consumed and no longer accepted.

Codes are never stored in plaintext: each code is hashed, and the hash is additionally encrypted at rest with the tenant's secret provider, so a storage dump yields ciphertext rather than an offline-brute-forceable hash.

## Passwordless Passkey Login

Passkeys aren't just a second factor: a user with an enrolled passkey can sign in without a password.

1. `POST /api/auth/mfa/passwordless/begin` returns a `challengeId` and assertion `options` for discoverable credentials, so the authenticator offers any resident passkey for the site
2. Client calls `navigator.credentials.get()` with the options
3. `POST /api/auth/mfa/passwordless/complete` with `{ challengeId, assertion }`: the server resolves the user from the passkey itself and signs them in

The hosted login page wires this into the email field via conditional mediation (passkey autofill): when the browser supports it, an available passkey is offered as an autofill suggestion without any extra UI.

A passkey is phishing-resistant strong auth, so the resulting session carries the MFA marker and is not re-challenged. If the user's email domain is routed to an external IdP via forced SSO, passwordless login is refused with a 409 `sso_required` response that includes the SSO redirect URL, so a local passkey can't sidestep the IdP.

## Managing MFA

### User Self-Service

- `GET /api/auth/mfa/status`, view enrolled methods (also reports whether MFA is offered by any client)
- `DELETE /api/auth/mfa/credentials/{id}`, remove a specific credential

Removing a credential requires a real authenticated session; a setup token only authorizes adding a first factor and gets `session_required` here, so a leaked setup token can't downgrade a user's MFA.

If the last primary method is removed, MFA is disabled for the user.

### Admin API

Administrators can manage MFA for any user via the [Admin API](admin-api):

- `GET /api/v1/profile/{userId}/mfa`, view a user's MFA status
- `DELETE /api/v1/profile/{userId}/mfa`, reset all MFA (for locked-out users)
- `DELETE /api/v1/profile/{userId}/mfa/{id}`, remove a specific credential

### Audit Hooks

Implement `IAuthHook.OnMfaVerifiedAsync` to log MFA events:

```csharp
public Task OnMfaVerifiedAsync(
    string userId, string email, string mfaMethod, CancellationToken ct)
{
    logger.LogInformation("MFA verified for {Email} via {Method}", email, mfaMethod);
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

The full MFA lifecycle is hookable: `OnMfaVerifyFailedAsync` (a failed verify attempt), `OnMfaEnrolledAsync` (a method confirmed), `OnMfaCredentialRemovedAsync` (a credential removed, with a flag for whether that disabled MFA), and `OnRecoveryCodesRegeneratedAsync`.

## Custom Login UI

If you're building a custom login UI, handle these responses from `POST /api/auth/login`:

1. **Normal login**: `{ userId, email, name }` with cookie set. Redirect to `returnUrl`.
2. **MFA required**: `{ mfaRequired: true, challengeId, methods, webAuthn? }`. Show MFA challenge form.
3. **MFA setup required**: `{ mfaSetupRequired: true, setupToken }`. Show MFA enrollment flow.

When handling `POST /api/auth/mfa/verify` errors: `invalid_code` and `assertion_failed` are retryable against the same `challengeId` (up to the attempt budget); `too_many_attempts` and `invalid_challenge` are terminal, so send the user back to the sign-in form.

See [Auth API](auth-api) for the full endpoint reference.
