# Admin API

Admin endpoints require a JWT access token with the `authagonal-admin` scope (configurable via `AdminApi:Scope`).

All endpoints are under `/api/v1/`.

## Bootstrapping the first admin token

Every `/api/v1/*` endpoint requires a bearer token carrying the admin scope, but the admin API itself (and [dynamic client registration](client-registration)) **refuses to create or update any client holding that scope** (`403 forbidden_scope`), so a runtime-created client can never escalate to admin. The only way to mint an admin token is a **config-seeded client**: entries in the `Clients:` configuration section are upserted at startup by `ClientSeedService`, and config is trusted, the forbidden-scope guard applies only to the runtime APIs.

Seed a `client_credentials` client with the admin scope in `appsettings.json` (or the equivalent environment variables / secret store):

```json
{
  "Clients": [
    {
      "Id": "admin-cli",
      "Name": "Admin CLI",
      "ClientSecret": "a-long-random-secret",
      "GrantTypes": ["client_credentials"],
      "Scopes": ["authagonal-admin"]
    }
  ]
}
```

(`ClientSecret` is hashed at startup; supply `SecretHashes` instead if you prefer to keep only a pre-hashed value in config. `ClientId`/`ClientName`/`AllowedGrantTypes`/`AllowedScopes` are accepted as aliases for `Id`/`Name`/`GrantTypes`/`Scopes`.)

Then exchange the credentials for a token at the standard token endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://auth.example.com/connect/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=admin-cli" \
  -d "client_secret=a-long-random-secret" \
  -d "scope=authagonal-admin"
```

```json
{ "access_token": "eyJhbGci...", "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 1800, "scope": "authagonal-admin" }
```

The `client_credentials` grant validates the requested scope against the client's `AllowedScopes`, since the seeded client holds `authagonal-admin`, the token is issued. Use it as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}` on every admin call:

```bash
curl https://auth.example.com/api/v1/clients -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci..."
```

Keep the seeded client's secret in your deployment's secret store; rotating it is a config change + restart.

## Users

### Get User

```
GET /api/v1/profile/{userId}
```

Returns the profile plus what a support console needs to diagnose a sign-in problem:
`emailConfirmed`, `isActive`, `lockoutEnd`, `accessFailedCount`, `roles`, the linked
`externalLogins`, and `hasPassword` (presence only, never the hash). That last one is the difference
between "they have forgotten their password" and "they have never had one, they sign in with SSO",
which are opposite pieces of advice.

Returns user details including external login links.

### User Exists

```
GET /api/v1/profile/{userId}/exists
```

Returns `204` if the user exists, `404` otherwise (a cheap existence probe, no body).

### Register User

```
POST /api/v1/profile/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass1!",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

Creates a user and sends a verification email. Returns `409 user_exists` if the email is already taken.

Optional admin-only fields: `userId` (caller-supplied id, `409 user_id_in_use` on collision), `emailConfirmed` (create the user already verified, skipping the verification email), `companyName`, `organizationId`, `phone`, `locale`, and `customAttributes` (a string map persisted on the user and forwarded to provisioning targets).

`skipProvisioning: true` creates the identity without running provisioning. It is for a first-party
app that is ITSELF a provisioning target and is already part-way through setting this user up: it is
calling here to mint the identity, not to be called back about a user it is in the middle of
creating. Without it that app receives its own Try for a half-built user, carrying only the
attributes that survived the round trip, and, if it recovers, ends up provisioning the user twice.

### Update User

```
PUT /api/v1/profile/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user-id",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "organizationId": "new-org-id"
}
```

`userId` is required; every other field is optional, only provided fields are updated.

`isActive` deactivates or reactivates the account. `emailConfirmed` (accepted as `emailVerified`
too) marks the address confirmed without sending a verification mail, for when possession has been
established some other way.

Changing `organizationId`, or deactivating, triggers:
- SecurityStamp rotation (invalidates all cookie sessions within 30 minutes)
- All refresh tokens revoked

A block that only takes effect at next login is not a block, which is why deactivation revokes
rather than waiting for expiry.

### Search Users

```
GET /api/v1/profile/search?q=jane&maxResults=20
```

Prefix search over the email and name indexes. Returns `{ "users": [ ... ] }`.

### Get User by Email

```
GET /api/v1/profile/by-email?email=jane@example.com
```

Exact lookup, distinct from search, which is a prefix match and may return several people. A caller
resolving "this address" to "this account" wants one answer or none. `404` if there is no such user.

### List Users

```
GET /api/v1/profile?organizationId=&count=100&continuationToken=
```

Cursor-paged directory listing; pass the returned `continuationToken` back for the next page, and
stop when it is null. Cursors rather than offsets because the store pages by token: an offset would
re-scan from the start every page.

### Which Users Exist

```
POST /api/v1/profile/exists
Content-Type: application/json

{ "userIds": [ "a", "b", "c" ] }
```

Returns the subset that exist, plus `truncated: true` when the request exceeded the 500-id cap, so
a caller is told its batch was trimmed rather than silently answered about 500 of 600. For
reconciling an id set against another system's.

### MFA Status for Many Users

```
POST /api/v1/profile/mfa-status
Content-Type: application/json

{ "userIds": [ "a", "b", "c" ] }
```

Returns `{ "statuses": { "a": true, "b": false }, "truncated": false }`: `true` means the user has at least one MFA credential. Capped at 500 ids; `truncated: true` says the request was trimmed. For "uses MFA" badges on a directory view.

### Set a Password

```
POST /api/v1/profile/{userId}/set-password
Content-Type: application/json

{ "password": "N3w!Password" }
```

The support path for someone locked out of an account whose address no longer reaches them. Subject
to the password policy. Revokes every refresh token and rotates the security stamp: a password
change that leaves the old sessions running has not changed who can act as that person.

### Unlock a User

```
POST /api/v1/profile/{userId}/unlock
```

Clears the lockout and its failed-attempt count, letting someone back in now rather than when the
lockout happens to expire.

### Delete User

```
DELETE /api/v1/profile/{userId}
```

Deletes the user, revokes all grants, and deprovisions from all downstream apps (best-effort).

### Confirm Email

```
POST /api/v1/profile/confirm-email?token={token}
```

### Send Verification Email

```
POST /api/v1/profile/{userId}/send-verification-email
```

### Link External Identity

```
POST /api/v1/profile/{userId}/identities
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "provider": "saml:acme-azure",
  "providerKey": "external-user-id",
  "displayName": "Acme Corp Azure AD"
}
```

### Unlink External Identity

```
DELETE /api/v1/profile/{userId}/identities/{provider}/{externalUserId}
```

## MFA Management

### Get MFA Status

```
GET /api/v1/profile/{userId}/mfa
```

Returns MFA status and enrolled methods for a user.

### Reset All MFA

```
DELETE /api/v1/profile/{userId}/mfa
```

Removes all MFA credentials and sets `MfaEnabled=false`. The user will need to re-enroll if required.

### Remove Specific MFA Credential

```
DELETE /api/v1/profile/{userId}/mfa/{credentialId}
```

Removes a specific MFA credential (e.g., a lost authenticator). If the last primary method is removed, MFA is disabled.

## SSO Providers

### SAML Providers

```
POST   /api/v1/saml/connections                    # Create
GET    /api/v1/saml/connections/{connectionId}     # Get one
PUT    /api/v1/saml/connections/{connectionId}     # Update (partial: only supplied fields change)
DELETE /api/v1/saml/connections/{connectionId}     # Delete
```

Create requires `connectionName`, `entityId`, and **exactly one of** `metadataLocation` (a metadata URL) or `metadataXml` (pasted IdP metadata, for IdPs without a metadata URL, it is parse-validated and condensed at save). Optional: `nameIdFormat` (omit for the emailAddress default, `"none"` to omit NameIDPolicy, recommended for ADFS, or a NameID format URN), `signAuthnRequests`, `iconUrl`, `allowedDomains`, `disableJitProvisioning`, `organizationId`. Every connection gets a server-generated SP keypair; it is never returned by the API. See [SAML](saml) for details.

`organizationId` scopes the connection to one [organization](organizations): it is offered only when that organization is selected, its `allowedDomains` are matched only within it (and are *not* written to the tenant-wide SSO domain index), and everyone who signs in through it becomes a member of it. Omitted or `null` = a tenant-level connection. An organization that does not exist is `400 unknown_organization`. On update, `null` (the field absent) leaves the scope alone, `""` returns the connection to tenant level, and either direction rewrites the domain index accordingly. See [Organisation-scoped connections](self-service-sso#organisation-scoped-connections).

### OIDC Providers

```
POST   /api/v1/oidc/connections                    # Create
GET    /api/v1/oidc/connections/{connectionId}     # Get one
DELETE /api/v1/oidc/connections/{connectionId}     # Delete
```

Create requires `connectionName`, `metadataLocation`, `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `redirectUrl`. Optional: `iconUrl`, `allowedDomains`, `passthroughParams`, `organizationId` (same meaning as on a SAML connection, above). The client secret is protected at rest and never returned. See [OIDC Federation](oidc-federation).

### SSO Domains

```
GET    /api/v1/sso/domains                 # List all
```

## Clients

Manage OAuth clients at runtime. All routes require the `IdentityAdmin` policy (the admin scope).

```
GET    /api/v1/clients              # List all clients
GET    /api/v1/clients/{clientId}   # Get one client
POST   /api/v1/clients              # Create a client
PUT    /api/v1/clients/{clientId}   # Update a client
DELETE /api/v1/clients/{clientId}   # Delete a client
```

### Create / Update Client

```
POST /api/v1/clients
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "clientId": "my-app",
  "clientName": "My Application",
  "allowedGrantTypes": ["authorization_code"],
  "redirectUris": ["https://app.example.com/callback"],
  "allowedScopes": ["openid", "profile", "email"]
}
```

`POST` returns `409` if the client already exists. `PUT` updates an existing client (`404` if not found); on update, only newly-added scopes are escalation-checked.

Notes:

- **Secret hashes are never returned.** `clientSecretHashes` is stripped from every response (list, get, create, update). On update, omitting `clientSecretHashes` preserves the stored secret; supplying new hashes rotates it.
- **The admin scope cannot be granted to a client.** Requesting `AdminApi:Scope` (default `authagonal-admin`) in `allowedScopes` returns `403 forbidden_scope`, no client may hold the admin scope, otherwise a `client_credentials` client could mint admin tokens indefinitely.
- Adding scopes the caller is not permitted to grant returns `403`.

## Scopes

Manage custom OAuth scopes at runtime. See [OAuth Scopes](scopes) for the full scope model.

```
GET    /api/v1/scopes           # List all scopes
GET    /api/v1/scopes/{name}    # Get one scope
POST   /api/v1/scopes           # Create a scope
PUT    /api/v1/scopes/{name}    # Update a scope (only supplied fields change)
DELETE /api/v1/scopes/{name}    # Delete a scope
```

```
POST /api/v1/scopes
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "billing.read",
  "displayName": "Billing, read-only",
  "description": "View invoices and payment history",
  "userClaims": ["billing_plan"]
}
```

Returns `201` on create (`409` if the scope already exists), the scope JSON on get/update, and `204` on delete.

## Provisioning Apps

Manage downstream provisioning targets at runtime. All routes require the `IdentityAdmin` policy.

```
GET    /api/v1/provisioning/apps               # List apps (also returns the configured limit)
POST   /api/v1/provisioning/apps               # Create an app
PUT    /api/v1/provisioning/apps/{appId}       # Update an app
DELETE /api/v1/provisioning/apps/{appId}       # Delete an app
POST   /api/v1/provisioning/apps/{appId}/test  # Send a test /try call to the app's callback
```

### Create / Update Provisioning App

```
POST /api/v1/provisioning/apps
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Backend",
  "callbackUrl": "https://api.example.com/provisioning",
  "apiKey": "secret-api-key",
  "tryTimeoutSeconds": 30
}
```

- `name` and `callbackUrl` are required; `callbackUrl` must be an absolute `http(s)` URL.
- `tryTimeoutSeconds` is clamped to the range 5–300.
- **The API key is never returned.** Responses expose `hasApiKey` (a boolean) instead of the key itself. On update, omitting `apiKey` leaves it unchanged, an empty string clears it, and a value replaces it.
- Creation is subject to a configurable per-deployment quota (`IProvisioningAppQuota`); exceeding it returns `400 provisioning_app_limit`. The list response includes the current `limit`.

### Test a Provisioning App

```
POST /api/v1/provisioning/apps/{appId}/test
```

Sends a synthetic `POST {callbackUrl}/try` with a sample payload (and the app's API key as a bearer token if set) and returns `{ success, statusCode, body }` so you can verify connectivity from the admin UI.

## Roles

### List Roles

```
GET /api/v1/roles
```

### Get Role

```
GET /api/v1/roles/{roleId}
```

### Create Role

```
POST /api/v1/roles
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "admin",
  "description": "Administrator role"
}
```

### Update Role

```
PUT /api/v1/roles/{roleId}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "admin",
  "description": "Updated description"
}
```

### Delete Role

```
DELETE /api/v1/roles/{roleId}
```

### Assign Role to User

```
POST /api/v1/roles/assign
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user-id",
  "roleName": "admin"
}
```

Assignment is by **role name**, not role id. Returns the user's updated role list.

### Unassign Role from User

```
POST /api/v1/roles/unassign
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user-id",
  "roleName": "admin"
}
```

### Get User's Roles

```
GET /api/v1/roles/user/{userId}
```

### Users in a Role

```
GET /api/v1/roles/{roleName}/users?maxResults=200
```

The reverse of the above (who holds this role), answered from a role membership index rather than
by reading every user. Returns `{ "roleName": "...", "members": [ { "userId", "email", "firstName",
"lastName", "roles" } ] }`; each member carries their full role set, because a console listing one
role almost always wants to show what else its members have.

`404 role_not_found` for a role that does not exist, rather than an empty list: "nobody holds this"
and "you have misspelled the role" are different problems. `501 not_supported` if the configured
store does not index role membership, for the same reason: an empty membership list would read as
"nobody administers this".

Accounts written before the index existed are invisible to it until reindexed
(`IUserStore.ReindexUserAsync`, which upserts a user's memberships without removing any).

## SCIM Tokens

### Generate Token

```
POST /api/v1/scim/tokens
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "clientId": "client-id",
  "description": "Entra provisioning",
  "expiresInDays": 365
}
```

`description` and `expiresInDays` are optional (omit `expiresInDays` for a non-expiring token). Returns the raw token once. Store it securely, it cannot be retrieved again.

### List Tokens

```
GET /api/v1/scim/tokens?clientId=client-id
```

Returns token metadata (ID, created date) without the raw token value.

### Revoke Token

```
DELETE /api/v1/scim/tokens/{tokenId}?clientId=client-id
```

## Tokens

### Impersonate User

```
POST /api/v1/token?clientId=client-id&userId=user-id&scopes=openid%20profile
```

Issues tokens (access, refresh, and, when `openid` is requested, id token) on behalf of a user without requiring their credentials. Useful for testing and support. Parameters are passed as query strings.

| Query parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clientId` | Yes | The client the tokens are issued for. Token lifetimes come from this client's configuration. |
| `userId` | Yes | The user to impersonate. |
| `scopes` | No | **Space-separated** list of scopes (URL-encode the spaces). Defaults to the client's `AllowedScopes` when omitted. |

Restrictions:

- Scopes are constrained to the client's `AllowedScopes`, requesting any scope the client could not itself request returns `400 invalid_scope`.
- The admin scope (`AdminApi:Scope`, default `authagonal-admin`) **cannot** be issued through this endpoint; requesting it returns `403 forbidden_scope`. This prevents a (possibly time-limited) admin token from minting a long-lived admin access/refresh token.

The response is a standard token response with `access_token`, `refresh_token`, optional `id_token`, `expires_in`, and the granted `scope` (space-separated).
