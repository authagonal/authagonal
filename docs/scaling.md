# Scaling

Authagonal is designed to scale both vertically and horizontally with no special configuration.

## Stateless by design

All persistent state is stored in the backing store (Azure Table Storage, DynamoDB on the AWS backend, or PostgreSQL on the self-hosted SQL backend). There is no in-process state that requires sticky sessions or coordination between instances:

- **Signing keys**: loaded from Table Storage, refreshed hourly
- **Authorization codes and refresh tokens**: stored in Table Storage with single-use enforcement
- **SAML replay prevention**: request IDs tracked in Table Storage with atomic delete
- **OIDC state and PKCE verifiers**: stored in Table Storage
- **Client and provider configuration**: fetched per-request from Table Storage

## Cookie encryption (data protection)

ASP.NET Core's Data Protection key ring protects the auth cookie, so every instance must share one. It is persisted automatically, in this order:

1. `DataProtection:BlobUri`, if set (an explicit blob, authenticated with `DefaultAzureCredential`).
2. A `dataprotection` container in the account named by `Storage:ConnectionString`, unless that is Azurite.
3. On the managed-identity path (`Storage:TableServiceUri`), the sibling blob endpoint of the same account, `https://{account}.blob.…/dataprotection/keys.xml`. The identity needs Storage Blob Data Contributor on the account.

Only an unrecognised table endpoint (Azurite, path-style emulators) falls back to the per-machine file store, which is ephemeral and per-pod: restarts sign everyone out and replicas cannot read each other's cookies. The startup check logs `Critical` when that happens.

```json
{
  "DataProtection": {
    "BlobUri": "https://youraccount.blob.core.windows.net/dataprotection/keys.xml"
  }
}
```

On the AWS backend, pass an S3 client + bucket to `AddAuthagonalAwsStorage` to persist the key ring to S3, without it the key ring is in-memory and cookies break on restart and across nodes. See [Installation → AWS backend](installation#aws-backend). On the SQL backend the ring is persisted by `AddAuthagonalPostgres` / `AddAuthagonalSqlite`.

Persisting is not encrypting: the ring is plaintext XML unless `DataProtection:KeyVaultKeyId` or `DataProtection:CertificateThumbprint` is set. At startup a ring with no encryption and no keys yet is refused, and one that already has keys starts with a `Critical` log (`DataProtection:AllowUnencryptedKeyRing=true` accepts it deliberately). See [Configuration](configuration) for the full `DataProtection:*` table.

## Per-instance caches

A small number of read-heavy, slow-changing values are cached in memory per instance to reduce Table Storage round-trips:

| Data | Cache duration | Impact of staleness |
|---|---|---|
| OIDC discovery documents | 60 minutes (configurable) | Delayed awareness of IdP key rotation |
| SAML IdP metadata | 60 minutes (configurable) | Same |
| CORS allowed origins | 60 minutes (configurable) | New origins take up to an hour to propagate |

These caches are acceptable for production use. All durations are configurable via the `Cache` configuration section, see [Configuration](configuration). If you need immediate propagation, restart the affected instances.

## Rate limiting

Abuse-prone endpoints (registration per IP, password reset per target email, SCIM per client, dynamic client registration per IP, see [Configuration → Rate Limiting](configuration#rate-limiting)) are protected by a built-in rate limiter.

By default, limits are enforced **in-process per node** behind the `IRateLimiter` seam, so with N instances the effective ceiling is N× the configured value. That's deliberate: the limiter is a backstop against runaway abuse of a single node, and the authoritative global limit belongs at the edge (WAF / ingress / CDN), which sees all traffic before it's load-balanced.

That trade-off is right for the volume limits and wrong for one case: a budget guarding a **guessable secret**. The device flow's `user_code` is a short string from a small alphabet, and the attempt limit is the only thing standing between an attacker and a code that grants a live session. A ceiling that multiplies by replica count is the wrong shape there, and it makes the real bound a property of your ingress configuration rather than of the server.

Set **`Auth:DurableRateLimiting=true`** to move the counters into the store you already run, so every replica shares one budget. It costs a store round trip per rate-limit check, uses fixed windows (a budget of N allows up to 2N across a window boundary), and fails open if the store is unreachable, so it layers on the edge rule rather than replacing it. Counter rows are collected automatically on all three backends. See [Configuration → Cluster-wide limits](configuration#cluster-wide-limits-authdurableratelimiting).

## Clustering

Multiple instances coordinate through a **leader election** and a **cross-node event bus**, both behind pluggable backends:

- **Leader election**: a lease-based election (`Cluster:LeaseTtlSeconds`, default 30s, renewed at roughly half that interval). Exactly one node holds the lease; leadership transfers automatically when the leader dies. Leader-gated work runs only on the leader: signing-key *deactivation* at expiry (when `Auth:KeyRotationEnabled` is on), the grant reconciliation sweep (Azure backend only), the at-rest backfill (when `Auth:AtRestBackfillEnabled` is on; a non-leader waits briefly for leadership, then skips), and the rate-limit counter sweep (Azure backend with `Auth:DurableRateLimiting`). With `Cluster:Enabled=false` the single node is a permanent leader, so a standalone deployment still runs all of them.
- **Event bus**: cross-node notifications (e.g. cache invalidation in multi-tenant hosts), polled every `Cluster:PollIntervalSeconds` (default 3s).

Each instance generates a random 12-hex-char node ID at startup to identify itself; it is not persisted.

### Backends

The **default is in-process**: a single node is always its own leader, and events are local-only, correct for one instance with zero configuration. Multi-node deployments swap in a real backend via the `configureClustering` callback on `AddAuthagonal`:

```csharp
// Azure: leadership via a blob lease, event bus via a table log (Authagonal.AzureProvider)
builder.Services.AddAuthagonal(builder.Configuration,
    cluster => cluster.UseAzureStorage(blobServiceClient, tableServiceClient));

// AWS: leadership + event bus via DynamoDB (Authagonal.AwsProvider)
builder.Services.AddAuthagonal(builder.Configuration,
    cluster => cluster.UseAwsDynamo(dynamoDb));

// PostgreSQL: leadership via a conditional-upsert lease row, event bus via an
// append-only log in the same database (Authagonal.SqlProvider)
builder.Services.AddAuthagonal(builder.Configuration,
    cluster => cluster.UseSql(sqlDataSource));
```

`UseAzureStorageBus` / `UseAwsDynamoBus` / `UseSqlBus` register the event bus only, keeping the in-process (always-leader) lease, use them on nodes that must receive cluster events but must never contend for leadership.

> **Note:** with the in-process default on multiple nodes, *every* node believes it is the leader. That's harmless for most workloads, but enable a real lease backend before turning on `Auth:KeyRotationEnabled` across multiple instances.

Signing-key **generation** is separate from that leader-gated deactivation, and is not driven by it: every node calls `EnsureActiveKeyAsync` at startup and on each `Auth:SigningKeyCacheRefreshMinutes` refresh, so with `KeyRotationEnabled` off, the default, rollover at the 90-day expiry is driven entirely by that path. Generation takes its own short cluster lease, so it is single-writer wherever a real lease backend is configured. With the in-process default on multiple nodes there is no such coordination and two nodes that reach an expired key at the same moment can each generate one; both end up in the JWKS and tokens signed by either verify, but which key is reported active can flap. This is another reason to configure a real lease backend for multi-node deployments.

See the [Configuration](configuration#cluster) page for all cluster settings.

### Multi-tenant deployments

In multi-tenant mode (`AddAuthagonalCore()`), `TokenCleanupService`, `GrantReconciliationService`, `SigningKeyRotationService`, and the config seed services (clients, providers, scopes, roles) are not registered: they are part of the single-tenant `AddAuthagonal()` composition, and the host manages that work per tenant.

## Name-index hot partition

Admin name-prefix search is backed by the `UserFirstNames` / `UserLastNames` index tables, which use a **single hot partition**. At scale this caps index-write throughput at roughly 2,000 ops/sec, which can become a bottleneck on user create/update under heavy load. If you don't expose admin name search, set `Storage:NameIndexesEnabled = false` to skip these writes entirely. See [Configuration](configuration).

## Trusted-proxy and internal endpoints

When running multiple instances behind a load balancer:

- **Forwarded headers**: rate limiting and lockout key on the client IP, resolved from `X-Forwarded-For`. Set `ForwardedHeaders:KnownNetworks` to your ingress / pod CIDR so the client IP can't be spoofed across instances. `ForwardedHeaders:ForwardLimit` defaults to `1`. See [Configuration](configuration#forwarded-headers-trusted-proxy).
- **Internal endpoints**: `/_internal/backchannel-logout` requires `Cluster:Secret` in the `X-Cluster-Secret` header (compared in constant time). Without it the endpoint authorizes nobody and answers 404; source IP is not treated as a credential, because loopback is what a same-host reverse proxy presents for every forwarded request and a private range is every neighbouring workload in a shared cluster network. `Cluster:AllowLoopbackWithoutSecret` is a development-only opt-in that re-admits a loopback pre-forwarding peer. The shipped product never calls this route (session fan-out is in-process via `SessionTermination`), so it matters only for a fan-out you build yourself.

## Scaling recommendations

**Vertical scaling**: increase CPU and memory on a single instance. Useful for handling more concurrent requests per instance.

**Horizontal scaling**: run multiple instances behind a load balancer. No sticky sessions or shared caches required. Each instance is fully independent.

**Scale to zero**: Authagonal supports scale-to-zero deployments (e.g., Azure Container Apps with `minReplicas: 0`). The first request after idle will have a cold start of a few seconds while the .NET runtime initializes and signing keys are loaded from storage.
